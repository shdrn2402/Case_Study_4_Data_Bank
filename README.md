# Eight-week-SQL-challenge Visualization  

This repository contains visualizations of SQL queries executed as part of the [Eight-week-SQL-challenge](https://github.com/shdrn2402/Eight-week-SQL-challenge). The goal is to enhance data analysis by presenting query results in a clear and visually accessible format.  

## Features  
- Graphical representation of key insights from SQL queries  
- Data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Improved readability of trends, comparisons, and metrics  

## Purpose  
By transforming raw query results into intuitive charts and graphs, this project helps better understand patterns in customer behavior, data allocation, and financial transactions.  

## Tools Used  
- `Python` – Data processing and visualization  
- `Pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `Matplotlib & Seaborn` – Graph generation  

## Related Project  
This visualization is based on the SQL analysis from the [Eight-week-SQL-challenge](https://github.com/shdrn2402/Eight-week-SQL-challenge).  



## Contents:
- [Case Study #4 - Data Bank](https://github.com/shdrn2402/Eight-week-SQL-challenge_Visualization/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%234-Data%20Bank)


**Note:** This repository contains visualizations based on SQL case studies. Since the projects are educational and access to a live database is not available, all resulting tables were manually saved as CSV files. In a real-world scenario, direct database access could be achieved using appropriate Python libraries such as `SQLAlchemy` or `psycopg`.
